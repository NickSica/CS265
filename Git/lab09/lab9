Q1.1)
The program had a segmentation fault. There is a new file called core in the directory.

Q1.2)
The program bombed in the function inTable.

Q1.3)
c) It was passing an empty spot into strcmp because the index was increased before assignment. Either increase the index after assignment or start at 1 in the loop.
e) The problem is it isn't following the rules of PEMDAS and it is just evaluating the expressions from left to right. It can be fixed by reordering the linked list based on what input is passed, putting the more important items set to execute first.
f) Go into gdb and see where the crash is occuring and figure out what is causing the crash. You can put assertions in using tried and true methods that you know are correct comparing every element of the array to see if it is actually in order.

Q1.4)
The compiler can't catch logical or design errors, just errors in the syntax.

Q1.5)
The program would crash, because the strcmp function is looking for strings not integers.
